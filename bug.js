This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This commonly happens when using `useState` in functional components before the component has mounted.  The component might try to render before the state has a value, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.  For example:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Error: count might be undefined here!
  console.log(count * 2); // Possible error: Cannot perform calculation on undefined

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
