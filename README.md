# React Native: Uninitialized State Variable Access

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: accessing a state variable before it has been initialized using `useState`.  The error occurs because the component attempts to render and use the state variable before `useState` has assigned it a value.  This often results in unexpected behavior or crashes.  The solution involves conditional rendering or providing an initial value to `useState`.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` to start the app.
4. Observe the error in the console and the application's behavior.

## Solution

The solution file (`bugSolution.js`) demonstrates two approaches to fix this issue:

*   **Conditional Rendering:** Check if the state variable is initialized before using it.
*   **Providing an Initial Value:**  Provide an initial value to `useState` to avoid the undefined state.
